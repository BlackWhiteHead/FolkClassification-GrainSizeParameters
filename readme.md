This repository contains the source code to perform prediction and evaluation with example data. 

## Content
- predict_xgboost.py  
Python module containing the function to predict predict Folk's classes without gravel fraction.
- plot_evaluation.py  
Python script to generate the figures of confusion matrix and the ternary diagram of the example data.
- test.py  
Python script that loads the data from the file `example data.csv`, predicts the classes of each sample using the 
function in `predict_xgboost.py`, and generates the evaluation figures using the functions in `plot_evaluation.py`.
- example data.csv  
The data is an example for the prediction and visual evaluation.
- code.csv  
This file contains names of each class and their corresponding numbers.
- xgb_2.model  
Pre-trained model to predict whether a sample contains gravel. 
- xgb_cls.model  
Pre-trained model to predict the Folk's classes of samples without gravel fraction.
- xgb_2.raw  
Text file of the xgb_2.model
- xgb_cls.raw  
Text file of the xgb_cls.model

## Dependencies
The code has been tested using packages of:  
- Python (version 3.7)
- numpy (1.17.1)
- pandas (0.25.1)
- scipy (1.1.0)
- scikit-learn (0.22.1)
- python-ternary (1.0.6)
- matplotlib (3.1.1)


## Running the files
Running the code `test.py` will perform the prediction and evaluation. The results of data file and figures can be found in the folder "output\\".
